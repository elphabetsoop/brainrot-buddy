# Brainrot Buddy 🧠🧟

**Gamifying Code Quality with "Brainrot" Culture**

Brainrot Buddy transforms your coding frustrations into a chaotic, gamified experience. It replaces sterile IDE warnings with personality-driven feedback, using "brainrot" humor (slang, memes, chaotic visuals) to keep you engaged (and humble).

## Features

### 1. Reactive "Fried" Visuals 🍟
The extension visualizes your code health through **Bibble**, your virtual pet.
*   **Idle:** Bibble is "bingchilling".
*   **Errors:** As errors increase, the interface applies a "deep fried" visual filter (saturation + scaling).
*   **5+ Errors:** "BRO WTF R U DOING" + Maximum Saturation (Bibble turns red/distorted).

### 2. "Roast-Based" Static Analysis 🔥
Generic warnings are boring. Brainrot Buddy proactively "roasts" you for bad practices.
*   **Long Functions (>20 lines):**
    *   "Yo 'activeEditor' is 50 lines?? Touch grass fr"
    *   "did ChatGPT write this?"
    *   "Seek help fr"

### 3. "Lock In" Mode 🍅
Controlled procrastination to keep you productive.
*   **Meme Rewards:** Click Bibble to fetch memes from `r/programmerhumor`.
*   **The Limit:** After 10 memes, you are **LOCKED IN**.
*   **Lockdown:** Memes are disabled for 25 minutes (Pomodoro style), forcing you to focus.

### 4. Positive Reinforcement 🚀
*   **Hype Commits:** "FIRE COMMIT", "YES LAHHHH" speech bubbles when you commit code.
*   **Victory Screen:** Confetti explosions and Snorlax memes for successful actions.

## Installation

1.  Install via VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Open the "Brainrot Buddy" view in your Activity Bar.
3.  Start coding (and try not to crash out).

## Requirements

*   VS Code ^1.95.0
*   A sense of humor (and tolerance for Gen Z slang).

**Enjoy the brainrot!**
